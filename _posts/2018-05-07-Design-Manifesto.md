### Introduction


Designing a product is both an art and a science. It is subject to various morals, rules and regulations. My class Human Computer Interaction has revealed various principles that are key to designing a successful product. The following are lessons that I have learned while developing a personal project proposal and working on a group project - from ideation to prototyping.




### Process


The first part of my design process involves [asking questions and being creative](http://stephanieliu.me/hciproject/project-proposal/). Design’s role in society is to solve problems. In both my [project proposal](https://clifmak.github.io/2018-02-12-project-proposal/) and the [group project](http://stephanieliu.me/hciproject/project-proposal/) I had to identity a problem that needed to be solved. Identifying a problem is only one part of the battle. The designer always has to fight against confirmation bias. This is the part in which design becomes a science . Designers have to break down, de-construct and build-up the problem in order to understand it; They have to research the problem.


Researching a design problem is a multifaceted process. All stakeholders in the problem need to be considered. This can be done through contextual inquiries. Contextual inquiries involves talking to people who are directly affected by a problem. Its role is to help designers understand the nature of the problem. Designers can get evidence based knowledge about people’s needs, wants and wishes. For my group project, Art for All, the team was only able to understand what people want from a museum experience after conducting multiple contextual inquiries. The [contextual inquiries](http://stephanieliu.me/hciproject/design-research-goals-stakeholders-and-participants/) included a field trip to the museum, MASS MoCA.We interviewed five people. All participants in the inquiries mentioned that they wanted to be able to interpret art. Through the results of the contextual inquiries, we were able to conclude that the goal of our project would be to help museum-goers learn about and understand art. Observed participants mentioned that they wanted to "understand the art beyond the placard". This drove my group to find an appropriate solution.


The next stage of the process is [ideation](http://stephanieliu.me/hciproject/project-ideation/). This is a creative process in which designers come up with ways to address the identified problem. Information gathered from contextual inquiries and brainstorming is systematically sorted through affinity diagramming. Designers will then be able to hone on issues related to the problems, and specific tasks of the problems that need to be modified. User personas that reflect potential users, and scenarios connect to particular tasks are created. The Art for All group considered the spectrum of people interested in art, and how they responded to the task of finding background information on an artwork. Our user personas included people with little to no art experience, and people with moderate to expert level experience. We considered notes from the interviews we had conducted with people that fit the personas, and sorted them through affinity diagramming. We were able to note that learning was the goal of the museum experience, and people wanted to connect art to their lives. 


Understanding the problem and the potential solution are followed by effectively communicating the two phenomena. Storyboards and video sketches can indicate how users can solve the problem using the proposed technology. These forms of communication are often brief, rough, catchy and to the point. Art for All produced storyboards showing how users would accomplish two tasks using our design. Our two tasks were finding background information about a piece of art, and discussing art with others. 


After communicating the problem and solution, the next stage is creating a prototype of the solution. The prototype has to advance from a low fidelity prototype to a high fidelity prototype. The Art for All group created a paper prototype of our proposed solution. Creating the prototype was an iterative process. Our paper prototype went through a heuristic evaluation and user tests. The heuristic evaluation was carried out according to Nielsen’s Heuristic Principles. Test users were asked to complete a variety of tasks while Art for All team members observed them. Feedback from the evaluation and tests helped us identify strengths and pain points of our design. We adapted the paper prototype accordingly until we had a final paper prototype.

The final stage of the process is developing a high fidelity prototype. There are a variety of technologies that are available to help with the process. Designers should exercise caution because technologies can offer and take away various affordances. An iPhone application will only be used by people with iPhones while a web application can be accessed by people using different smartphones. The high fidelity prototype can start as a static design then transition to an interactive prototype.

### Contextual Inquiries provide insights on a problem


Conducting contextual inquiries forces the designers to look at the problem from the point of view of various stakeholders. My Art for All group only understood the fundamental nature of the problem of understanding art only after we talked got the perspectives of a wide range of people. It allowed us to find how various people saw the same problem in different ways. Without contextual inquiries it is very challenging to create a relevant design. A design is suppose to offer _certain affordances_ that are relevant to the user.

### Designers should aim to make the solutions accessible


Designers need to be aware of the requirements of people with various conditions. People that use screen readers should be able to navigate a designer’s application with need. It is important to make design choices that make a design accessible to people with various conditions. These design choices can range from button sizes to picture descriptions and captions. While developing the art for all prototype it was clear that we needed to provide background information in a variety of ways. However, the challenge was figuring the right balance of information to provide.  


### Prototyping is an iterative process


It is okay to fail and learn during the design process. Developing a prototype is a learning process. Creating a solution that caters to all stakeholders is a balancing act. A design has to be evaluated and tested. Art for All developed several prototypes as it learned the needs of its user’s. We added missing buttons, and removed an unnecessary panel. If you are not failing you are not learning anything about your design. If you are not breaking-up and rebuilding your design, you are definitely missing something.

### Usability testing can reveal how the user experiences the design


Designers often make assumptions about users. This can result in an ineffective design. What seems intuitive to designers might not be intuitive to the users. Conducting usability tests can help address designers’ bias, and reveal users actual experience. Our Art for All design had to highlight several key features, including a favoriting feature, which was not noticed by the user. Nielsen' 10 heuristic tests can helps show some aspects of usability that a design might have missed. It is a checklist that can help ensure a good design interface.


### The Design Process is a Team Effort


Developing a great solution requires time, effort, organization, and commitment. This is only possible if the people working on a project work well together. Team members bring a diversity of opinion, accountability and various expertise. Art for All members developed a [team contract](http://stephanieliu.me/hciproject/team-contract/) that determined our code of conduct. This ensured that we were always focused and realized our goals.

### Code of Ethics

1. _Don't be evil_ : Play nice, be good, and consider the social implications of your designs.
2. _Be conscious of that other people who are not like you_: Users might not think like you; therefore, be mindful when making design choices.
3. _Spread love not bad design_ : Don't encourage a culture of ableism, designs should be accessible to people of all abilities.
4. _Design for users not yourself_. You need to talk to them and understand what they need.
5. What seems intuitive to you the designer is not necessarily intuitive to the users.
6. _Simple_ and _clear_ design is the best way to effectively communicate with the user !
