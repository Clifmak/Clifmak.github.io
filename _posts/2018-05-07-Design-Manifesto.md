# Design Manifesto

## Introduction

Designing a product is both an art and a science. It is subject to various morals, rules and regulations. My class Human Computer Interaction has revealed to me various principles that are key to design a successful product. The following are lessons I have learned developing a personal project proposal, and working on a group project - from ideation to prototyping.

### Process


The first part of my design product involves asking questions and being creative. Design’s role in society is to solve problems. In both my project proposal and the group project I had to identity a problem that needed to be solved. Identifying a problem is only one part of the battle. The designer always has to fight against confirmation bias. This is the part in which design becomes a science . Designers have to break down, de-construct and build-up the problem in order to understand it; They have to research the problem.


Researching a design problem is a multifaceted process. All stakeholders in the problem need to be considered. This can be done through contextual inquiries. Contextual inquiries involves talking to people who are directly affected by a problem. Its role is to help designers understand the nature of the problem. Designers can get evidence based knowledge about people’s needs, wants and wishes. For my group project, Art for All, the team was only able to understand what people want from a museum experience after conducting more contextual inquiries. The inquiries included a field trip to the museum, MASS MoCA.


The next stage of the process is ideation. This is a creative process in which designers come up with ways to address the identified problem. Information gathered from contextual inquiries and brainstorming is systematically sorted through affinity diagramming. Designers will then be able to hone on issues related to the problems, and specific tasks of the problems that need to be modified. User personas that reflect potential users, and scenarios connect to particular tasks are created. The Art for All group considered the spectrum of people interested in art, and how they responded to the task of finding background information on an artwork.


Understanding the problem and the potential solution are followed by effectively communicating the two phenomena. Storyboards and video sketches can indicate how users can solve the problem using the proposed technology. These forms of communication are often brief, rough, catchy and to the point. Art for All produced storyboards showing how users would accomplish two tasks using our design.
After communicating the problem and solution, the next stage is creating a prototype of the solution. The prototype has to advance from a low fidelity prototype to a high fidelity prototype. The Art for All group created a paper prototype of our proposed solution. Creating the prototype was an iterative process. Our paper prototype went through a heuristic evaluation and user tests. The heuristic evaluation was carried out according to Nielsen’s Heuristic Principles. Test users were asked to complete a variety of tasks while Art for All team members observed them. Feedback from the evaluation and tests helped us identify strengths and pain points of our design. We adapted the paper prototype accordingly until we had a final paper prototype.


The final stage of the process is developing a high fidelity prototype. There are a variety of technologies that are available to help with the process. Designers should exercise caution because technologies can offer and take away various affordances. An iPhone application will only be used by people with iPhones while a web application can be accessed by people using different smartphones. The high fidelity prototype can start as a static design then transition to an interactive prototype. 

## _Five Points on the Design Process_


### 1. Contextual Inquiries provide insights on a problem.


Conducting contextual inquiries forces the designers to look at the problem from the point of view of various stakeholders. My Art for All group only understood the fundamental nature of the problem of understanding art only after we talked got the perspectives of a wide range of people. It allowed us to find how various people saw the same problem in different ways. Without contextual inquiries it is very challenging to create a relevant design.

### 2. Designers should aim to make the solutions accessible.


Designers need to be aware of the requirements of people with various conditions. People that use screen readers should be able to navigate a designer’s application with need. It is important to make design choices that make a design accessible to people with various conditions. These design choices can range from button sizes to picture descriptions and captions. While developing the art for all prototype it was clear that we needed to provide background information in a variety of ways. However, the challenge was figuring the right balance of information to provide.

### 3. Prototyping is an iterative process.


It is okay to fail and learn during the design process. Developing a prototype is a learning process. Creating a solution that caters to all stakeholders is a balancing act. A design has to be evaluated and tested. Art for All developed several prototypes as it learned the needs of its user’s. We added missing buttons, and removed an unnecessary panel.

### 4. Usability testing can reveal how the user experiences the design


Designers often make assumptions about users. This can result in an ineffective design. What seems intuitive to the design might not be intuitive to the users. Conducting usability tests can help address designers’ bias, and reveal users actual experience. Our Art for All design had to highlight several key features, including a favoriting feature, which was not noticed by the user.


### 5. The Design Process is a Team Effort.


Developing a great solution requires time, effort, organization, and commitment. This is only possible if the people working on a project work well together. Team members bring a diversity of opinion, accountability and various expertise. Art for All members developed a team contract that determined our code of conduct. This ensured that we were always focused and realized our goals.
