## Context-Based Design of Mobile Applications for Museums : A Survey of Existing Practices

### Introduction

 The paper is a review of mobile applications used in museum environments, and it focuses the notion of context and its constituent dimensions. Museum context often influences interaction. Raptis et al. argue that effective interaction design needs to take into consideration multiple dimensions of context. 
 
### Argument

 Mobile computing research suffers from fundamental method methodological weaknesses because the field often considers real ethnographic studies unimportant. This results in multiple issues that are left to be investigated. Effective and efficient positioning and context awareness methods are needed to present useful information to the user with respect to the environment. The mobile device should be carefully mapped to the natural environment. Designer must address the best ways to making use of the real to support the virtual and visa-versa. Context is important to anticipate design challenges. It is often broad, ambiguous and ill-defined. Dix et al proposed a framework that decomposed context to four dimensions: system, infrastructure, domain and physical. System context focuses on technological aspects that make up the system. Infrastructure concerns the connections between the devices that constitutes the system. Aspects related to specific situation interactions take place in a domain context. The physical context is the relation of the system with the physical environment. Raptis et al. studied context dimensions of various systems to examine the significance of context. They concluded that in order to provide users with systems that cover their needs, a deeper understanding of contextual issues is required. I agree with this conclusion because museum visits are interactive and social experiences, mobile applications should consider the context of visitors’ experiences. Raptis et al show that for interaction to be effective, both sides (the user and the system) should be able to use implicit situational information.
 
### Conclusion

Raptis et al. paper applies to our project, Art for All, because the paper analyzes mobile applications used in museum environments. The design for our project presents a mobile application that is used in a museum environment. The systems studied by Raptis, to a lesser extend, address the problem Art for All hopes to solve. Our project can be improved by using Raptis’ suggestions. The definition of context used in our design is severely limited because it reduces the environment to the artwork and the user. Including the four dimensions of context could help us identify problems and present solutions for our proposed designs. One aspect mentioned in the paper that our design already touches upon is the presentation of contextualized and personalized information to the user. Art for All’s design allows the users to design a user profile, and abstracts various layers of information that can be helpful to a museum visitor irrespective of their experience.
