# **A Collegially Bad Design**

What makes a good design ? Is it functionality, interface or beauty ? Like most people I struggle to define 'a good design'. Any meaning of the phrase would involve a moral judgment call, and moral decisions are hard to make ! A design can be 'neutrally good' or 'lawfully good'. It is as complex as the people who use it, and can take on their character. I had to make a character judgement of the following design based on my moral compass.

## Sawyer Library's Floor Level Sockets

I was walking in Williams College's Sawyer library, contemplating good and bad designs, when I accidentally stepped on the cover of one of the library's  floor level socket cover's, and almost lost my balance. I have long disliked the library's floor level sockets because they were not designed for use in a public space like library. College students and faculty use the sockets to charge their devices. The floor level sockets are communal devices, but they were poorly designed because of the following reasons :

1. The interface is not friendly for a first-time users. Is an ethernet port, an electrical outlet or a tunnel to Hogwarts inside the compartment ?

2. There are no directions indicating that there are sockets in the floor level compartments. 

3. The floor level socket's cover is clunky and difficult to open. It can be hazardous, when it is open, because it extends above ground level and library visitors can trip over the cover.

4. Library users have to kneel or crouch to connect their devices to the socket. The sockets are about 10 cm deep with the compartments.

Certain trade offs were made in the design of Sawyer Library's floor level sockets. Emphasis was placed on functionality rather than on user experience. Floor level sockets are convenient to students, but they are dangerous as indicated above. Making the floor level sockets difficult to open discourages students from becoming reliant on the floor level sockets. This reduces the risks associated with the sockets. 

Designers are faced with some conscious choices when making devices. A design has the potential to influence behavior and vice versa. Similar to an investment in the financial market, the success or failure of a design is often only apparent after the fact. Designers have to find a balance between usability and functionality of a device.
