# **A Collegially Bad Design**

What makes a good design ? Is it functionality, interface or beauty ? Like most people I struggle to define 'a good design'. Any meaning of the phrase would involve a moral judgment call, and moral decisions are hard to make ! A design can be 'neutrally good' or 'lawfully good'. It is as complex as the people who use it, and can take on their character. I had to make a character judgement of the following design based on my moral compass.

I was walking in Williams College's Sawyer library, contemplating good and bad designs, when I accidentally stepped on the cover of one of the library's  floor level socket cover's, and almost lost my balance.

College students and faculty use the sockets to charge their devices.
