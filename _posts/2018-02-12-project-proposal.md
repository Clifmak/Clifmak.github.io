## A Communal Natural History

![Technology-nature-590x392.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/img/Technology-nature-590x392.jpg)


### Introduction




The introduction of smartphones, the internet and social media have fundamentally changed our relationship with nature. People are now more connected through social media, but our communities have drifted further apart.  Communal environments have been damaged through exploitation of resources, climate change and other factors. There is a great need to reestablish our relationship with nature, and strengthen our communal bonds. Technology can be used to address these problems.



### Analysis of Problem



Technology has taken the place once occupied by nature and community. Teenagers spend a significant amount of time playing computer games and  on social media. Little premium is placed on connecting with natural environment, and getting to know people in the community. It is a near certainty that technology will have the dominant role in this times. The values of nature and community need to  find a place in this new world. To have a real impact, this place needs to be beyond Instagram and Facebook posts. It needs to have a positive impact on the environment and community. 

Nature is an infinite repository. There are innumerable species of animals and trees to discover in our environment. Communities need to take pride in their environments. They need to be responsible custodians of nature. Teenagers deserve the joy of the natural environment. Network effects of technology can be used to rally people for environmental causes. Technology can be used by citizens to capture the biodiversity of communities.

### Solution

I propose a digital communal platform to be used to capture  the natural environment in a community. This can be through historical, biological and anthropological studies. The platform could can be a repository of a community’s nature. It would store all the type of trees and animals in a  community, and indicate their species, age and other factors.  The platform will be activity centered. People have to venture into nature to record information for the repository. Pictures and videos of trees, animals and anything that contributes to the natural environment will be catalogued. This platform will be a community’s natural history document.  Technology will bring the community together to celebrate nature.
