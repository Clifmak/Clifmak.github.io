#  **A Collegially Good Design**

When I was looking for a good design, I looked for something I didn't necessarily felt passionate about. I wanted a design I objectively agreed was good. This essentially meant a balance between functionality and usability. I chose a device I have been conditioned to accept, but never realized the goodness of the design until now.


## Paresky's Floor Level Sockets

The design of Williams College's Paresky Center's floor level sockets finds the perfect balance between usability and functionality. It was clearly designed for communal use. It is a good design because of the following reasons :

1. It is easy to use. One does not need directions. One can simply 'plug and play'. 

2. Access to the sockets can easily be controlled.

3. The design is simple and looks elegent.

4. The use of steel, a heavy duty material, makes the floor level sockets durable.

The simplicity of the design highlights its functionality and usability. The device is minimal, efficient and sufficient. It is 'neutrally good'.
